			<h1>Will ECB's monetary policy lift Italian economy? Probably</h1>
		</div>

			<p>Italian economy seriously stagnates, as the GDP growth in the fourth quarter leveled off from the previous quarter, marking the 14th consecutive quarter without any expansion. The economy has been contracting since the third quarter in 2011. For the full year 2014, the GDP shrank 0.4 percent.</p>
			<p>But OECD estimates that Italian economy will recover by mid-2015 mainly due to quantitative easing by European Central Bank. “ECB monetary policy support is expected to ease financial conditions and facilitate a resumption of bank lending, which should raise investment. The projected revival of Italy’s export market will also support stronger growth,” OECD said in a forecast summery.</p>

			<p>The unemployment rate declined to 12.9 percent in December from 13.3 percent in November, which was an all-time high. Compare with the year ago of 12.6 percent, the situation has slightly worsened. The jobless rate has been rising since a record low of 5.9 percent in April 2007, especially hitting young generations as the youth unemployment rate recorded 42 percent in December.</p>
			<p>Italian credit is given BBB- from Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 from Moody’s and BBB+ from Fitch. Fitch affirmed Italy’s long-term foreign and local currency issuer Default rating at BBB+ in October. A government debt to GDP was 132.6 percent in December 2013, which was one of the highest figures in the world. The credit rating of 62.09 points is lower than China, Botswana, Chile and Israel.</p>

			<p>The FTSE MIB (Milano Italia Borsa) index is an Italian major stock market index, which tracks the performance of 40 leading companies listed on the Borsa Italiana in Milan. The index grew 12.29 percent to 22337.79 index points on Feb. 27 from a year ago. I assume that what is happening in the Italian stock market is what was happening in Japan when the Bank of Japan decided to do affirmative monetary policy. My understanding is that Italian stocks will rise further mainly due to the QE by the ECB until the current or the atmosphere changes.</p>

			<p>Euro has been significantly weakening since the ECB started QE, marking $1.12 on Feb. 27, which is tremendously good news for Italy as its economy is heavily relying on exports such as wines, olive oils, cheese, vegetables, cars, notable brand clothes and numerous traditional crafts.</p>
			<p>Regarding monetary policy, on Jan. 22, the ECB announced an asset purchase program expanding its amount of package to €60 billion. “Asset purchases provide monetary stimulus to the economy in a context where key ECB interest rates are at their lower bound,” the ECB said in a press release. “They further ease monetary and financial conditions, making access to finance cheaper for firms and households. This tends to support investment and consumption, and ultimately contributes to a return of inflation rates towards 2 percent.”</p>
			<p>The ECB cut September its main refinancing rate, which is also Italian interest rate because Italy is a member of EU, to 0.05 percent and the overnight deposit rate to -0.2 percent, which means that the ECB will charge banks for holding their money overnight to encourage them to lend money.</p>

			<p>In terms of politics, Italy has an unusual situation: Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is still 40 years old, the youngest top politician in its history. The former president of Florence Province took his office on Feb. 22, 2014, promising that he will achieve a new phase of radical reform to stimulate the Eurozone’s third-largest economy by clearing rigid political and social structures. An election of new president Sergio Mattarella on Jan. 31 would be good symbol for the Renzi administration.<p>
			<p>In conclusion, although Italian economy is still in the middle of recession, it comes to see the light at the end of long tunnel. New politics situation, weakened Euro and strengthened stock market by QE would serve as a spur to energize Italian exports industries.</p>
			<p>But high jobless rate remains the biggest concern, especially when big companies and older generation receive the benefit of economic reform at the expense of younger generation. The Renzi administration would be force to manage a difficult tag-of-war between domestic-oriented industries and exports companies, and between the generations.</p>
